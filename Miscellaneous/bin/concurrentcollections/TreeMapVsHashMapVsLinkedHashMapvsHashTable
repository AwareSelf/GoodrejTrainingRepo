Details about TreeMap, HashMap and LinkedHashMap that help to differentiate them are given as 
follows âˆ’

TreeMap in Java
A TreeMap in Java is implemented using a Red-Black trees. 
It has key-value pairs i.e. keys that are associated with the values and the keys are ordered. 
A TreeMap can only have unique elements and cannot have a null key but have null elements.


HashMap in Java
A HashMap in Java is implemented using an array of linked lists. 
It has key-value pairs i.e. keys that are associated with the values and the keys 
are in arbitrary order. 
A HashMap can only have unique elements and can have only one null key but multiple null 
elements.



LinkedHashMap in Java
A LinkedHashMap in Java is implemented using doubly linked buckets. 
It has key-value pairs i.e. keys that are associated with the values and the keys are ordered by 
their insertion order. 
A LinkedHashMap can only have unique elements and can have only one null key but multiple null 
elements.


Sr. No.	Key	HashMap	HashTable
1	Introduction	
Hashmap is the advanced version of HashTable and is introduced as a new class in JDK 1.2.	
HashTable on the other hand is the legacy class and was introduced prior to HashMap.

2	Internal implementation	
Internal implementation of both classes is same upto some extent but in case of HashMap one null 
key and multiple null values are allowed.	

HashTable internally implemented in such manner that it does not allow any null key or any 
null value.

3	Synchronization	
Synchronization is not implemented in HashMap and is not thread safe so can't be shared between 
many threads without proper synchronization code.	

On the other hand, HashTable is synchronized and is thread safe so can be shared with many threads.

4	Traversed 
the elements	HashMap provides Iterator for its iteration in order to traverse the values 
stored in it.	
On the other hand along with Iterator HashTable also provides Enumerator to traverse the values 
stored in it.

5	Index performance	
Due to the absence of synchronization HashMap is faster as compare to HashTable and is preferred 
when synchronization is not needed.	

Synchronization in HashTable makes it slower as compare to HashMap but also eliminate the 
writing of extra code to obtain the synchronization.

6	Inheritance	
HashMap inherits AbstractMap class.	
On the other hand, HashTable inherits Dictionary class.
